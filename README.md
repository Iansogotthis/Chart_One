    CREATE DATABASE project_square_db;
    ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and provide your MySQL database credentials. This file will store sensitive information securely:

    ```plaintext
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=your_username
    DB_PASSWORD=your_password
    DB_NAME=project_square_db
    ```

### Starting the Application

1. Start the server and client application by running the following command:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Your application will be accessible at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram

The Key Entities are:

- **Square**
- **Modal**
- **Chart**
- **User Interaction**

### Attributes for Each Entity:

**Square:**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `size`
- `color`
- `type` (root, branch, leaf, fruit)
- `parent_id` (Foreign Key, self-referencing)

**Modal:**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `type` (Edit Label, View Scale, View Scope, Include/Exclude)
- `content`
- `square_id` (Foreign Key references Square.id)

**Chart:**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `svg` (SVG element)
- `viewBox`
- `preserveAspectRatio`

**User Interaction:**

- `id` (Primary Key)
- `action` (click, hover, save)
- `timestamp`
- `square_id` (Foreign Key references Square.id)
- `modal_id` (Foreign Key references Modal.id)

### Relationships

- **Square (1) --- (M) Square:** Self-referencing relationship for parent-child hierarchy.
